# Implementation

Hi. 

The princess is in another castle. Just kidding.

So I created this repository before fully reading the requirement of there being a "implementation" folder.
That's why my implementation is located in the root of this Github repository.

It's a Java Maven project, so the /pom.xml and /src/* folders are the ones that should be considered the implementation.

Hopefully this doesnt effect the points too much.
